Operating System 
    - a basic set of programs which each computer includes.

What are this 'Set of Programs?
    - kernel is one of these programs (and also the most important);
    - other programs are less crucial utilities;

Kernel
    - most important program in this set of programs;
    - loaded into RAM when the system boots and contains many critical procedures that are needed for the
      system to operate;
    - kernel provides key facilities to everything else on the system and determines many of the characteristics
      of the higher software.

Hence, we often use the term "Operating System" as a synonym for "Kernel".
